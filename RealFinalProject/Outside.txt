You jumped off the second floor of the house.
You badly injured your kneecap.
You started to get extremely nauseous
Its raining heavy.
You have to look for safety and run as best you could.
You see a green street light about 2 miles away.

*panting*
"I can make it. I believe in hope."
"I only see hope. I don't want to die."

While you're running through trees you start to hear something that
gives you high adrenaline to make it through...
