"The house looks better from the inside than the out."
"As what most people don't realize."
"Really not much to do from first impressions."
"Speaking of first impressions, did the person who handed me the key expected me to go hunting?"

This part of the house seems to be the living room.
Against the wall theres a T.V. and chair sitting about 8 feet away parallel from eachother.
Electricity surprisingly still runs in this house.
A coffee table sits inbetween the T.V. and chair.
Hanging off the wall above the T.V. is a hunting rifle and a frame of something.
