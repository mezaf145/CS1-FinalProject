This 2 story house outlasted the others because it's made of concrete. 
Floor, roof, ceiling. Only one of four glass windows remains, wavy and yellowed by time.
It seems there's no plumbing and no electricity from the outside.
There are little cracks here and there. Radiation didn't hit this house too hard.
