"Hello, uh.. the name's Finn Sanchez"
"I am currently 26 years old. I am a male. I live in New york."
"Ya think that's how you start these stupid tapes?"
"I don't know, the damn therapist recommended this."
"I'm only doing this so that he would shut up about it."
"Been feeling slow lately. Sleeping is still rough. Nightmares are still kicking in."
"Nothing to be worried about."
"The only thing im worrying about is finding a job; surviving."
"Parents won't help me ever since I screwed up."
"Makes me feel guilty saying that lightly."
"Whatever"
"Tomorrow I'm going to Ukraine. Or Russia I think. There's no difference between the two anyway."
"Apparently there's a home I can stay for the week. According to these wannabe journalists, people just disappear there."
"These journalists only talk about it and report the peeople's disappearances but their too much of a !@$%&."
"Guess they are too scared to catch something from the event 4 years ago."
"Some power plant failed and killed thousands. Even if they survived, they didn't survive much longer in their lives."
"First journalist to get off his lazy @#$ to do something very dangerous."
"I'll show them who's committed."
